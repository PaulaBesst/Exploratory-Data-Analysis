# Supermarket Sales Exploratory Data Analysis ðŸ›’
## Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis of supermarket sales data across three branches, analyzing customer behavior, product performance, and sales patterns to derive actionable business insights.
## Introduction
In today's competitive retail environment, an in-depth understanding of sales data is vital for informed business decisions. This project evaluates the sales performance of a supermarket company across multiple dimensions - from identifying the highest-performing branch to assessing popular products and examining customer satisfaction.
The dataset includes historical sales data covering a three-month period (January to March 2019) from three branches of the supermarket company located in different cities:

Yangon (Branch A)
Mandalay (Branch B)
Naypyitaw (Branch C)

Data Analysis Process
The analysis follows these key steps:
### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Data validation and cleaning
Feature extraction (day, month, year from date)
Data type conversions and formatting

### 2. Exploratory Analysis

Univariate Analysis:

Customer rating distribution
Payment method preferences
Product category distribution


Bivariate Analysis:

Sales performance by month
Gross income by city
Product line performance by branch


Correlation Analysis:

Relationships between numerical variables
Patterns between sales, customer ratings, and time factors



### 3. Business Questions Addressed
The analysis answers key business questions including:

What was the total amount of sales?
Which branch has the highest sales?
What type of product is sold the most?
Which day of the week has the maximum sales?
What time is best to display an advertisement to maximize revenue?
Which product line should the supermarket focus on?
Which city should be chosen for expansion and which products should it focus on?
